# CNN-From-Scratch
## Letter Recognition with Custom Convolutional Neural Network using Numpy and Python

This project consists of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch using Numpy and pure Python**. The model is trained using a *train.csv* file that contains only two letters - **O and X.** The CNN has been trained to identify the letters accurately and achieve high prediction accuracy. The *letters.csv* file is used to test the CNN's accuracy, which includes **6 O's and 6 X**'s.  

The CNN uses the *Sigmoid* function, which provides two outputs: the percentage of the output being X and the percentage of the output being O. The console displays the output of the NN and the classification results. For example, "***Processing letter number=12 Output of NN 0.273 ==> 0.727 Result: Class=X***". The CNN has been tested successfully and was able to identify all the correct X's and O's with high accuracy. 

The *parameters.csv* file generates the weights and biases after training the model. It contains the learned parameters that are used to make predictions on new data. 

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning and deep learning using custom-built neural networks. It is a great example of how to build a neural network from scratch using only fundamental programming languages and libraries.
